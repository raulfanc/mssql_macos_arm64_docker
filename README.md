Guide and Practice
## **Use Case**: 
- **As** a Data Engineering Learner
- **I wanted to** run Microsoft SQL Server on my arm64 (apple silicon) chip Macbook
- **Not only**, Docker sql server is incompatible with apple's silicon chip
- **But also**, `SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)` is not available in MacOS
- **So that** I made this guide, we are going to successfully build up sql server (any versions) on a apple silicon or intel chip MacOS.

Detailed guide refer to [MS_SQLServer with MacOS apple silicon](./mssql/mssql_apple_silicon.md)
